**Cypress Javascript End To End Framework:**

Hi, I have setup a Cypress/Javascript test automation framework from scratch. The tests cover most of the Cypress queries, commands and chai assertions.

ðŸ‘‰ Specifications:

Version: 12.9.0

Language: Javascript

Design Pattern: Page Object Model

Practice Website: https://rahulshettyacademy.com/

Test Framework: Mocha


ðŸ‘‰ In this project I have showcased my ability to :

Locate objects using Jquery methods and CSS selectors

Manipulate the objects and act on them using various Cypress actionable methods

Clean Code by using custom commands to promote re-usability

Organise object locators through Page Object Model

Usage of Chai assertions 

Structure the tests using Mocha test framework (hooks)

Organise test data inputs using fixture file 

ðŸ‘‰ CI/CD :

Configured Github Actions to trigger tests when a push event occurs
